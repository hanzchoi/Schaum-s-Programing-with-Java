/**
 *  3.8
 *  Write a program that generates a random year between 1800 and 2000 and then report whether if it is a leap year.
 *  A leap year is an integer greater than 1584 that is either divisible by 400 or is divisible by 4 but not 10.
 *  To generate an integer in the range 1800 to 2000, use
 *      int year = Math.round(200*x + 1800);
 *  Where x is a random float. The round() method of the Math class returns the integer nearest the float passed to it.
 *  The transformation y = 200x + 1800 converts a number in the range 0 <= x < 1 into a number in the range
 *  1800 <= y < 2000.
