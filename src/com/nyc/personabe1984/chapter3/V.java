/**
 * 3.22
 * write a program that simulates a guessing game, where the computer "thinks" of a number from 1 to 100,
 * and the user tries to guess the number. After each wrong guesses, the computer gives them by reporting
 * whether that guess was too high or too low. Use the conditional expression operator, like this:
 *
 *      System.out.println("No: that's too " + (guess<x ? "low." : "high." ) );
 *
 * Give the user five guesses before revealing the number. Here is a sample run:
 *      I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 100.
 *      Guess what it is: 55
 *      No: that's too low.
 *      Guess again: 77
 *      No: that's too high.
 *      Guess again: 66
 *      No: that's too low.
 *      Guess again: 71
 *      No: that's too high
 *      Guess again: 68
 *      No: the number was 70
